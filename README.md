# Introduction

New World Buddy is a desktop application that is meant to be used along while playing "New World".
It provides tools to
- browse ingame items
- calculate resources for crafting
- bookmark favourite items
- track stock values and item prices
- track armorsets
- track tradeskill progression

# Development

This repository does not include the ingame data. Ingame data needs to be extracted from a local "New World" installation during development. (A "how-to" will be added in future)

Besides that, the software is based on following technologies

- Yarn
- Angular
- Tailwind css (Daisy UI)
- Electron

For build commands please see package.json
